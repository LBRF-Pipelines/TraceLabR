# another trial that went short but it was a slower one
# so there was enough points to make it past filter... 
# not sure how to filter... minimum points for each stimulus_gt?


#### now do the same with SHAPE rather than RAW, and ALL DAYS ####

# p43_s1_b1_t13 - looks like got cut off half way... therefore maybe impliment a ratio of data points?

# p53_s1_b2_t2 - I can't tell wtf is happening here.... it's like they did a second tracing... 
# like way too many points... 
# maybe I need an upper limit of points too?

# p55_s5_b3_t7 - looks like just a shitty trial where they didn't end well... too many points
# at end, but not remaining still so the mt_clip thing didn't really work. error not that high here tho. 
# forget about this one

# p17_s2_b5_t20 - looks like got cut off, way too few points... ratio should help

# p60_s4_b2_t7 - this participant looks to just be really crappy in all their trials
# like not touching screen hard enough. it jumps around. ratio might help.
# looked at all data â€” session 4 sucks but they look ok otherwise... weird.

# p52_s1_b1_t7 - got cut off / not enough points

# p11_s5_b1_t4 looks like got cut off on way back across... so not enough points

# p7_s3_b3_t10 looks like it was kinda incomplete... maybe not enough points

# p62_s2_b4_t14 looks like a normal trial but they just did bad... 

# p62_s4_b4_t4 just looks like a bad trial...
