 # TraceLabR

This repository contains the original R analysis scripts used for the published manuscript [Ingram, Solomon, Westwood, and Boe (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2018.10.030).

The import and preprocessing scripts in this repository have been superseded by those in the [TraceLabAnalysis](https://github.com/LBRF/TraceLabAnalysis) pipeline template, which have been used for all subsequent projects using the [TraceLab](https://github.com/LBRF/TraceLab) paradigm.
